    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Monday"><a href="#Monday" class="headerlink" title="Monday"></a>Monday</h1><p>I don’t know how I want to format these posts yet, so I’ll just fill these lines with whatever I desire.<br>I was dissapointed by the solar eclipse today, the entire حدث (event) what a bore. The earth was slighlty grayer, but that’s all it was. I find it weird theres a big ball of fire in the sky we aren’t allowed to look at. I don’t have much to write, as aforementioned this is my first time.</p><p>Today I learned that if you constantly find yourself smiling around those around you, then those people are for life.</p><h1 id="Tuesday"><a href="#Tuesday" class="headerlink" title="Tuesday"></a>Tuesday</h1><p>After 29 days and 29 nights I am free. Fasting is deceptive. It seems easy at first, but many realize that the real challenge is continuing to fast for around 30 days. I took for granted being able to indulge myself with food. Never again will I mock those who are emanciated. I don’t have the faintest idea of what else I could write about, but I hope that over these next few weeks, I ameliorate my writing skills and learn to express myself more.</p><p>Today I learned that hunger is more than than a biological deficit, it also affects the mind.</p><h1 id="Wednesday"><a href="#Wednesday" class="headerlink" title="Wednesday"></a>Wednesday</h1><p>Today is عيد الفطر. I prepared myself for a feast accordingly, and worse my best clothes. This year eid felt different. I was compressed between 2 kids and had to escape quickly before I became flatened. I remember that life is not meant for us to only work but to also enjoy ourselves and have fun. I am once again incapable of writing anything else. </p><p>Today I learned how grief-stricken someone must feel if they were to lose their kids.</p><h1 id="Thursday"><a href="#Thursday" class="headerlink" title="Thursday"></a>Thursday</h1><p>[Empty]</p><h1 id="Friday"><a href="#Friday" class="headerlink" title="Friday"></a>Friday</h1><p>[Empty]</p><p>I guess I wasn’t able to finish this week. School simply takes a huge cut from my time, leaving me with no time left to work on this blog. I hope as the days go by, I’ll have more time to write. As of right now, my writing ability is terrible and I am still trying to improve every day. </p>]]></content>

This my first time writing in my free time, so I don’t know what to put here. I wish to share my writings with you (poems, haikus, etc.) and talk about any skills I’ve been developing, or any other projects I’m working on.</p><p>I also want to share any pictures or videos I take, and any beats I make. I hope to continue to update this blog, even after I graduate from high school. </p><p>If anyone will even really read this, welcome and I hope you enjoy.</p>]]></content>
